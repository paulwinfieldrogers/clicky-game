This app was created using Create React App.
The application renders different images of cows to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.  The user is notified whether they chose correctly or not.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

When starting the screen looks as follows:

Once you start playing your score will increment if you pass the value of 3 (in this example) your score will be the new high score noted.
